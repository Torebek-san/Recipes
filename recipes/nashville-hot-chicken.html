        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hot take: The first bite of a Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich should send your tastes buds screaming, walking the thin line between pleasure and pain.</p>
        <p>It should be savory, salty, spicy, and hot but not so hot that you absolutely can’t taste the other spices and the juicy deep-fried meat. And yes, it should be served with pickle chips on a white bun or bread.</p>
        <p>If you want to make your chicken less spicy (we all have our personal limits on what we consider hot and spicy) that’s totally fine, but try not to get too fancy pants with this chicken sandwich. The beauty of Nashville Hot Chicken is in its simplicity. There’s no need for a brioche or sourdough bun or to add tomatoes or (gasp!) avocado. This is not the time to gild the lily! The focus here is the chicken itself.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine buttermilk, hot sauce, eggs, and salt in a large shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper in another large shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Dip the chicken in the dry flour mixture to coat all sides.</li>
            <li>Then dip and flip the chicken in the buttermilk mixture.</li>
            <li>Dip the chicken back in the dry flour, creating a double coating. This will fry up slightly thicker and stay crisp when you brush the spicy sauce over it.</li>
            <li>Set aside on a large baking pan while you repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
        </ol>
