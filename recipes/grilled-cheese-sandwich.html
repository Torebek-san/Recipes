                <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is the first thing a lot of people learn to cook. It was the first thing I learned to cook. I'd shave off a few slices from the ubiquitous big orange block of Velveeta in our fridge, slather Roman Meal bread with Promise margarine, and make the best meal nine-year-old me could ever want.</p>
                <p>Maybe you didn't grow up grilling processed cheese on squishy sandwich bread. Or maybe you know plenty well how to make grilled cheese, but you want to up your game. Great news—this grilled cheese party is open (and useful) to all experience levels!</p>
                <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put bread slices butter/mayo-side-down on a sheet pan, place cheese over each bread slice, and bake in a preheated 425°F oven until the cheese is bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Then close the sandwiches and bake until toasty, about 5 minutes longer.</li>
                </ol>
